# CS100 - Assn2: RSHELL

We will be implementing a command shell using C++ called rshell which reads in a
single command line at a time of with n number of arguments. It then executes the commands and arguments using C++ syscalls in the order that it was written. The program is exited once the user types in “exit” into the command line.

## Known bugs
* Needs to have well commented
* Not enough sufficient test cases
* Not executing commands with ;, &&, and ||

### Rubric
* 5 points for well commented code
* 20 points for sufficient test cases
* 20 points for executing single commands
* 20 points for executing commands with ;, &&, and ||
* 20 points for executing commands with comments
* 10 points for exit commands
