# CS100 - Assn3: RSHELL

## Test Command
* Added the test command and the [] equivalent where it checks if the file or directory exists, if the path given is a file, and if the path given is a directory. It returns 0 (True) if the test worked properly and returns 1 (False) if the test failed.
## The Precedence Operators
* Added a parentheses class where commands and arguments have precedence.

## Known bugs
* Odd number of brackets for test command still doesn't work

### Rubric
* 5 points for well commented
* 5 points for following style guidelines
* 20 points for sufficient test cases
* 40 points for test operator (including integration with precedence and past requirements)
* 30 points for precedence operators (including integration with test and past requirements)
