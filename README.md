# CS100 - Assn2: RSHELL

We will be implementing a command shell using C++ called rshell which reads in a
single command line at a time of with n number of arguments. It then executes the commands and arguments using C++ syscalls in the order that it was written. The program is exited once the user types in “exit” into the command line.
